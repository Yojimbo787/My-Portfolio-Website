                    <h1>What Got Me Into Web Development?</h1>
                    <p>What got me into web development was a bit of an accident. I was in university and doing a course that I wasn't enjoying at the time. I can remember the tutor of the class introduce us to HTML which at the time was completely foreign to me. After spending time in the class playing around with HTML I completly fell in love with the concept of designing a webpage. So, I then decided to look at doing short courses on understanding HTML & CSS. Straight away I realised that it felt natural to me and also found I had a natural eptitude to building webpages and eversince then I have been learning about web development and developing the skills required to make great looking pages.</p>

                    <p>In terms of my education background I have been someone who didn't do particularly well in school and struggled as a result due to poor learning environments but that never stopped me from wanting to learn and make something of myself instead of being another statistic of a forgotten generation that was let down by the education system of the UK.</p>
